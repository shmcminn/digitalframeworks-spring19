# Final project details

You must complete a final project for this class. The project has two components:
1. A 1,0000-word story based substantially on a dataset, due at or before the second to last class
1. In the second-to-last class, a fellow student will interview you about the piece

The 1,000-word piece should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

For the interview component, I’m looking for something like what CNN or NPR regularly does when they bring the author of an interesting story in to give some details. The interviewer must be prepared with 3 or 4 questions, and the interviewee needs to be prepared to go into detail about the story and the reporting behind it. The interviewee should, as much as possible, use non-technical language as if they were communicating to a mass audience about how they broke the story.

The final project is all together worth 30% of your grade. It will break down as follows:

* 15% for written story
* 5% for data visualizations
* 3% for your role as interviewer (on someone else’s topic)
* 7% for your role as interviewee

Examples of successful final projects from previous terms include:
* What is floating around in the Pacific Ocean, based on data from Ocean Conservancy’s international cleanup
* How did skatbacks (smaller running backs) perform vs. running backs as a whole, based on a dataset collected by the student
* How does the number of women running for congress correlate with the number of women who vote, historically (required combining two separate datasets).

# Github and Markdown

## Why Github?

For this class, your homework needs to be turned in on Github. Why? Because Github is how many folks who work with code and data share things. The goal of this assignment is to get you to a point where you can comfortably find and share things on github if that's what your collaborators are using. So by the end of this quarter:

* You should be able to commit files to github
* You should be able to find someone else's code/data on github if they direct you to it
* You will have a github profile and a few samples of your own work available on github, showing that you know how to use it

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language that plays particularly well with github, producing nice, readable documents (like this one!). Since most of our assignments will involve writing, you'll submit them using markdown.

## Assignment

### To be submitted before the start of the next class

1. Create a Github account. Add your account name to this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecIde_f94gBxx71HizXG4Cyk3h3br18pgC8ZYOLcGmRYdk3g/viewform?usp=sf_link) so I know where to find your homework.
1. Create a repository called *digitalframeworks-summer2018*. You will submit all your homework there.
2. Create a new file called assignment1.md
2. Think about two story ideas you would want to do your final project on. They can be broad for now, but the quicker you get to a specific idea, the easier it will be to complete further assignments. Think about specific questions you would want to ask that data can help you find an answer to. For example:
   * For story about campaign finance: How many PACs spend more on employees than they do giving to candidates?
   * For story on the World Cup: Do teams with players who have competed before have a better success rate than those who don't?
1. Write approximately 100 words telling me about each story idea, with at least one specific question for each you think you can answer with data.
1. For each idea, find one story from the past year that has a data component somewhat related to your pitch. It can be a visual, graphic, video or text story.
2. Critique the story [following this template](https://github.com/shmcminn/digitalframeworks-spring18/blob/master/critique_template.md) in your markdown file. Include a hyperlink (written as 
`[link text](http://www.linkurl.com)`) to the original story.
1. Include at least the following features in your writeup, to show you know how to use markdown:
   * A heading
   * A list or table
1. Commit this assignment in your digitalframeworks repository.

## Reminder

At the beginning of each class, I will call on 1-2 students to share a data story they noticed during the week, so keep your eyes out and come to class prepared with at least one link to a data story.
